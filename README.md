## Data Source 

The data was sourced by performing web scraping operations across several news sites, sports betting sites, blog sites, and wikipedia. 
The data was compiled together and published on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), an open source platform for getting open source public datasets, for anyone intending to conduct further analysis on the dataset.
The links to the dataset are: [2018/2019 Season](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielakhabue/npfl-2018-2019-season), [2019/2020 Season](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielakhabue/npfl-nigeria-professional-football-league-19-20), [2020/2021 Season](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielakhabue/npfl-2020-2021-season), [2021/2022 Season](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielakhabue/npfl-2021-2022-season).

## Data Extraction
The datasets were compiled into one  CSV (.csv) file as worksheets and imported into PowerBI. 

## Data Transformation
Before the dataset was loaded into PowerBI, it was first transformed.
+ New Features were engineered from the existing features, and added to each of the data set  [W, L, D, GF, GA, Ordinal Position].
+ A new table called Teams was cretaed for analysis on the most consistent teams across all four seasons.
+ The transformed data was then apllied to the visualization panel.

## Data Modelling
New relationships were created between the tables, and Teams was used as the relationship between all the tables.

## Data visualization
+ A measure table was created and Total Matches Played, Total Goals Scored, Avearge Goals Scored per Match  were all calculated using DAX.
+ Charts, Tables, and Cards were used to check for:
   + Top Teams with most Goals in the Season
   + League Standings

## Data Publishing
The data was published from the PowerBI environment and a link was generated for others to view and interact with the dashboard.
