## Data Source 

The data was sourced by performing web scraping operations across several news sites, sports betting sites, blog sites, and wikipedia. 
The data was compiled together and published on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), an open source platform for getting open source public datasets, for anyone intending to conduct further analysis on the dataset.
The links to the dataset are: [2018/2019 Season](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielakhabue/npfl-2018-2019-season), [2019/2020 Season](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielakhabue/npfl-nigeria-professional-football-league-19-20), [2020/2021 Season](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielakhabue/npfl-2020-2021-season), [2021/2022 Season](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielakhabue/npfl-2021-2022-season).

## Data Extraction
The dataset was compiled in CSV (.csv)  spreadsheet(.xlsx) formats and imported into PowerBI. 

## Data Transformation
Before the dataset was loaded into PowerBI, it was first transformed.
+ The columns that were not needed for the analysis were removed [Transaction Id, Customer_ Id, Year_Month, Time].
+ The columns were converted to the right datatypes especiall the date column which was converted to the date datatype.
+ The value of Transaction_result was changed as 0 = Transaction failed and 1 = Transaction Successful.
+ The value of Transaction Start was changed to Transaction start.
+ The City['Los Angles'] was changed to City['Los Angeles'] for effective representation of the city on a map chart.
+ A date table was created using PowerBI date query code. 
You can find the code here: [PowerBI Date query code](https://github.com/Apprentice-doa/PowerBI-E-Commerce-Data-Analytics/blob/45be5e8cdba7cd96d9386aeb8132e80b1dcd63ea/PowerBI%20Date%20Query%20Code)
+ A new table was created by duplicating the main table and the Transaction result was filtered to have just Transaction Successful.
+ The transformed data was then apllied to the visualization panel.

## Data Modelling
New relationships were created between the tables, and date was used as the relationship between the three (3) tables.

## Data visualization
+ A measure table was created and total revenue, number of Successful transactions, number products sold, average daily transactions were all calculated using DAX.
+ Charts were used to check for:
+ Expected Revenue by Transaction result
+ Revenue by City
+ Revenue by Device Type
+ Revenue by Date
+ Revenue by Category
+ Revenue by Gender
+ Date and Customer Login type filters were created as well.
